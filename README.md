Pymaceuticals

In this study, 250 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. 

# Summary of the study results:
1. There is almost an even split of male versus female test
2. While most drugs caused tumor volumes to increase with time, Capomulin and Ramicane were the only ones effective at reducing or containing the tumor volumes
3. Capomulin was the most effective drug in reducing the average tumor size
4. There appears to be a strong linear correlation between weight and tumor volume
